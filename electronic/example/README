Dirrectory "nx x ny x nz" should contain:
	Dirrectory conf:
		conf.par  -- configuration generated from relaxation
	
	runScript -- submission script to generate input files. The grid
	setting will have to expand the number of grid points for larger
	NCs, and the filter settings need to be adjusted for optimal
	calculation. 

To run submit runScript via PBS:
	qsub runScript
or run on the local machine
	bash runScript

Scripts will likely need re-configuring to run properly on a new machine

After execution:
	Dirrectory filter -- results of the single quasiparticle calculation
		eval.dat - list of quasiparticle energy levels and the varriance
		 		   associated with that state. A variance below ~1e-6 
		 		   indicates a state is generally a real eigensate of the
		 		   system while high variance indicates a spurious state.


	Dirrectory bse -- results of the excitonic calculation
		exciton.dat - list of excitonic states generated from the BSE 
					  calculation. Additional values of the expectation
					  values of the direct, exchange and quasiparticle
					  parts of the BSE hamiltonians (in hartree), and 
					  the exciton binding energy (in eV) are given for
					  each excitonic state.
		spins.dat - list of the total spin expectation vaules along the
					x,y,z directions and the S_tot^2 expectation value
					for each of the excitonic states. 
		OS.dat - oscillator strength and diploe matrix elements for each
				 excitonic state, also broken down along the x,y,z axes.
