These source codes calculate the excitonic states of perovskite nanostructures. 
They require (at least) the FFTW, Intel MKL, and OpenMP libraries at compile time.
If the MKL libraries are unavailable the MKL functions may be replaced with the 
standard LAPACK functions but this may require some re-configuring in particularly
in the diag.c file.

If the system is configured the code may be compiled by running:
make bs
