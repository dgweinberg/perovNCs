These source codes calculate the quasiparticle states for perovskite nanostructures. 
They require (at least) the FFTW, Intel MKL, and OpenMP libraries at compile time.
If the MKL libraries are unavailable the MKL functions may be replaced with the 
standard LAPACK functions btu this may require some re-configuring in particularly
in the ortho.c and projectors.c files.

If the system is configured the code may be compiled by running:
make spinOrbitFilter

An additional helper code for generating gaussian *.cube files for visualizing
the quasiparticle states can be generated by running:
make cube
