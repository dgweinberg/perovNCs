Dirrectory "nx x ny x nz" should contain:
	Dirrectory conf:
		conf.par  -- configuration generated from relaxation
	
	runScript -- submission script to generate input files. The grid
	setting will have to expand the number of grid points for larger
	NCs, and the filter settings need to be adjusted for optimal
	calculation. 

To run submit runScript via PBS:
	qsub runScript
or run on the local machine
	bash runScript

Scripts will likely need re-configuring to run properly on a new machine

After execution:
	Dirrectory filter -- results of the single quasiparticle calculation

	Dirrectory bse -- results of the excitonic calculation
